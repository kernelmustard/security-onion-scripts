# so-rmnode
A script to automate removing a node from a running Security Onion deployment

Confirmed works with sensors, have not figured out how to automate removal from cross-cluster search (yet)

Future Features
- Automate rehoming a sensor
- Reorganize scripts so related functions are in files and imported via main script
- Do we really need to remove a search node?
