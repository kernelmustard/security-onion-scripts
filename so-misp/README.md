# securityonion-misp
* a suite of scripts to ingest threat indicators from MISP *

## Prerequisites:   
- Security Onion (installed,configured)
- MISP Instance and API Key   
  
## Download and Configure (on Master or Standalone)
- Clone the repo:   
`git clone https://github.com/kernelmustard/security-onion-scripts/so-misp`   
- run the installer (note: have your MISP running and API key handy)
  - `bash ./so-misp/so-misp-install` 
- Update rules (if desired):   
`sudo so-misp-install` will update them at runtime if NIDS rules are imported
`sudo so-rule-update` will force an update in-between daily 0601 runs of the `so-misp-download` cronjob
- Confirm rules in place:    
`grep -i misp /opt/so/rules/nids/all.rules`    
- Confirm Zeek Intel in place:    
`cat /opt/so/conf/zeek/policy/intel/intel.dat`

A cron job will run every morning at 6:01AM to download new NIDS rules and Intel.

Any previously configured intel files will be wiped away (bug)
